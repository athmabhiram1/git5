PART A — What to do in Git Bash (from zero to rebase)
1. Open Git Bash and go to your project directory
cd path/to/your/project


If Git is not initialized yet:

git init

2. Check your branches
git branch


You should see:

* main
  fb


If fb does not exist, create it:

git branch fb

3. Add a file and make the first commit on main

GitHub cannot track anything without a commit.

echo "Initial commit" > file.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit on main"

4. Create a GitHub repository (IMPORTANT)
On GitHub:

Go to github.com

Click New Repository

Repository name → any name

DO NOT initialize with README

Click Create Repository

You will get a repo URL like:

https://github.com/username/reponame.git

5. Connect local repo to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git


Verify:

git remote -v

6. Push main branch to GitHub
git push -u origin main


Now main exists on GitHub.

PART B — Work on fb branch and push it
7. Switch to fb
git checkout fb

8. Make changes in fb
echo "Feature branch change" >> file.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Commit from fb branch"

9. Push fb to GitHub
git push -u origin fb


Now both main and fb exist on GitHub.

PART C — Fetch + Rebase (CORE of Experiment 5)

Assume someone updated main on GitHub (or you want to simulate it).

10. Switch to main and make a new commit
git checkout main
echo "Update from main" >> file.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Update on main"
git push origin main

11. Switch back to fb
git checkout fb

12. Fetch latest changes from GitHub
git fetch origin


This updates:

origin/main


but does NOT merge anything.

13. Rebase fb onto updated main
git rebase origin/main


What this does:

Takes your fb commits

Re-applies them on top of latest main

Keeps linear history

14. If conflict occurs (IMPORTANT FOR VIVA)

If Git stops and shows conflict:

Open the conflicted file

Fix conflict

Save file

Run:

git add file.txt
git rebase --continue

15. Push rebased fb (force required)
git push origin fb --force


Why force?

Rebase rewrites history

Normal push will be rejected

PART D — What happens on GitHub

On GitHub:

main → latest clean commits

fb → rebased on top of main

Commit history is linear

No unnecessary merge commits

(Optional)

You can create a Pull Request from fb → main

FINAL EXAM-READY SUMMARY (VERY IMPORTANT)

Commands used:

git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
git rebase --continue
git push origin fb --force


Purpose of rebase:

Incorporate latest remote changes

Maintain clean, linear commit history

Avoid merge commits
